<h2>Parallel-port LED driver</h2>

The LedActor sends a data byte out the parallel port (/dev/lp1) of the PC which
VSS is running on.  It is intended for sending to a particular homebrew
circuit which sends 2+3+3 bits of brightness data to a red, green and blue
LED respectively.  It's been tested only under Linux as of 1/5/2000.
<p>

Don't create more than one LedActor;  it wouldn't make sense, since you
don't have more than one /dev/lp1.<p>

To use the LedActor, load ledlpt.so and create an actor of type LedActor.

<h3>LedActor messages</h3>

In addition to the messages understood by all actors, the LedActor understands the following message:

<dl>
	<dt>SetBrightness <tt>hActor x</tt>
	<dd>Scale the overall brightness to <tt>x</tt>: 0 is dark, 1 is full brightness.
	<dt>SetHue <tt>hActor x</tt>
	<dd>Set the hue to <tt>x</tt>.  As <tt>x</tt> varies from 0 to 1,
	hue moves smoothly through six regions:
		<ul>
		<li> 0.00 red
		<li> 0.17 red+green
		<li> 0.33 green
		<li> 0.50 green+blue
		<li> 0.67 blue
		<li> 0.83 blue+red
		<li> (1.00 red again, wrapping around)
		</ul>

	<dt>SetBlink <tt>hActor period dutycycle</tt>
	<dd>Blink the LED.  Alternate its current hue-and-saturation settings
	with darkness.  A blink happens every <tt>period</tt> seconds,
	and the relative length of the lit portion compared to the length
	of the period is <tt>dutycycle</tt> (in the range 0 to 1).
	<br>
	So if <tt>dutycycle</tt> is 0, it stays dark no matter what the hue or
	brightness or period is.
	And if <tt>dutycycle</tt> is 1, it stays lit no matter what the period is.
	<br>
	If the period is 0 (the default), no blinking happens (the LED
	stays on).
	If the period is less than 0.05, it is rounded down to 0:
	blinking at faster than 20 Hz is doubtfully meaningful.
