<h2>A signal input actor</h2>

The InputActor, when instantiated with BeginSound, plays whatever signal VSS 
is receiving on its input port.  Note that you must run "vss -input" to enable 
the input port in vss.  (Audio input processing consumes extra resources,
so it makes sense to use those resources only if they are really needed.)
<p>
To use the input actor, load input.so and create an actor of type InputActor.

<h3>InputActor messages</h3>

The InputActor understands no other messages besides those
understood by all generator actors.

<h3>InputActor handler messages</h3>

The handler for the InputActor algorithm understands no other messages
besides those understood by all generator actors.
<p>

A common use of the InputActor is to send the audio signal at VSS's input
to another actor for further processing.  In this case, send a
<tt>SetMute 1</tt> message to the InputActor handler, so the input signal
is not "echoed" at VSS's output.  For example:<br>
<pre>
	hInpActor = Create InputActor;
	hInpSound = BeginSound hInpActor SetMute 1;
	hProcessorActor = Create MyProcessorActor;
	hProcessedSound = BeginSound hProcessorActor SetInput hInpSound;
</pre>
