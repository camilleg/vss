<h2>A simple sequencer</h2>

The Sequencer actor stores a time-stamped list of messages to be sent to (other) actors.  Any message that a client can send to an actor can be added to a SequenceActor and then played back later. <p>

To use the Sequencer implementation, load seq.so and create an actor
of type SeqActor. <p>

(<i>Note:</i> if you misspell SeqActor as
"SequenceActor" or "SequencerActor" (the way you probably pronounce it),
it'll still work.  You'll get a SeqActor.  No warning is issued for this.
Normally if you misspell an actor's name,
you get error messages about undefined actors and DSO's not loaded;
this case is an exception.)

<h3>SeqActor messages</h3>

In addition to the messages understood by all generator actors, the SeqActor understands the following messages:

<dl>
	<dt>SetTempo <tt>hActor x</tt>
			<dd>Set the tempo of this sequence to <tt>x</tt> beats per minute (default is 60).
	<dt>SetBeatLength <tt>hActor x</tt>
			<dd>Set the tempo of this sequence to <tt>x</tt> seconds per beat (default is 1, obviously, from above).
	<dt>AddMessage <tt>hActor beat message... </tt>
			<dd>Add an event to the list at time <i>beat</i>, in beats from the start of the sequence.  <i>message...</i> is the message to be sent.
	<dt>SetNumLoops <tt>hActor numloops</tt>
			<dd>Set the number of times to execute the body of the sequence.<br>
			Defaults to -1, which means to loop forever.<br>
			0 means don't do it at <i>all</i> (i.e., don't play anything);<br>
			1 means do it once;<br>
			2 means twice, and so on.
	<dt>SetLoopStart <tt>hActor <i>beat</i></tt>
			<dd>Set the loop start point to <i>beat</i> (default 0).
	<dt>SetLoopEnd <tt>hActor <i>beat</i></tt>
			<dd>Set the loop end point to <i>beat</i> (default 1 million).
	<dt>JumpTo <tt>hActor <i>beat</i></tt>
			<dd>Change the position of playback to <i>beat</i>.
	<dt>Rewind <tt>hActor <i>beat</i></tt>
			<dd>Change the position of playback, backwards, to <i>beat</i>.  If <i>beat</i> is omitted, it defaults to zero.
	<dt>SkipEvents <tt>hActor <i>count</i></tt>
			<dd>Fast-forward, skipping the next <i>count</i> events.  (Skipping backwards doesn't work as of this writing.)
	<dt>Active <tt>hActor <i>activeStatus</i></tt>
			<dd>Play or pause the sequence (<i>activeStatus</i> is 1 or 0 respectively).
</dl>
