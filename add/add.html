Additive Synthesis Actor</H2>
<HR>The Additive Synthesis Actor performs harmonic-spectrum additive
synthesis.  At most 30 harmonics ("partials") are computed.

<P>To use the Additive Synthesis Actor, load add.so and create an actor
of type AddActor.
<H3>
AddActor messages</H3>
In addition to the messages understood by all generator actors, the AddActor
understands the following messages:
<DL>
<DT>
SetFreq <TT>hActor x</TT></DT>

<DD>
Set the default fundamental frequency for new instances created by this
actor to <TT>x</TT> Hz.</DD>

<DT>
SetAllFreq <TT>hActor x <I>time</I></TT></DT>

<DD>
Set the fundamental frequency of all children to <TT>x</TT> Hz, and also
set the default fundamental frequency for all future children to <TT>x</TT>
Hz. If <TT>time</TT> is specified, children will modulate to the new frequency
over the specified duration. Default frequency is always set immediately
regardless of <TT>time</TT>.</DD>

<DT>
SetAmplPartials <TT>hActor array</TT></DT>

<DD>
Set the default amplitudes of the first few partials (however many are
specified) for new instances created by this actor to <TT>array</TT>.</DD>

<DT>
SetIthAmpl <TT>hActor i x</TT></DT>

<DD>
Set the default amplitude of the i'th partial (starting from 0 as the base
partial) for new instances created by this actor to <TT>x</TT>.</DD>

<DT>
SetAllIthAmpl <TT>hActor i x <I>time</I></TT></DT>

<DD>
Set the amplitude of the i'th partial of all children to <TT>x</TT>, and
set the default amplitude of the i'th partial for all future children.
If <TT>time</TT> is specified, children will modulate to the new amplitude
over the specified duration. Default amplitude is always set immediately
regardless of <TT>time</TT>.</DD>

<DT>
SetFDPartials <TT>hActor array</TT></DT>

<DD>
Set the default frequency deviations of the first few partials (however
many are specified) for new instances created by this actor to <TT>array</TT>.
<br>
As the FD value for the i'th partial ranges from -1 to 1,
the i'th partial will have a frequency ranging 
from that of the (i-1)'th to that of the (i+1)'th.
<br>
In other words:
Frequency deviation is expressed in deviated portion of fundamental frequency
with range of [-1, +1].
New partial frequency = original harmonic frequency + FD*fundamental frequency.
So FD=-1 brings the partial down to the partial below it, FD=1 up.
</DD>

<DT>
SetIthFD <TT>hActor x</TT></DT>

<DD>
Set the default frequency deviation of the i'th partial for new instances
created by this actor to <TT>x</TT>.</DD>

<DT>
SetAllIthFD <TT>hActor i x <I>time</I></TT></DT>

<DD>
Set the frequency deviation of the i'th partial of all children to <TT>x</TT>,
and set the default amplitude of the i'th partial for all future children.
If <TT>time</TT> is specified, children will modulate to the new value
over the specified duration. Default value is always set immediately
regardless of <TT>time</TT>.</DD>
</DL>

<H3>
AddActor handler messages</H3>
In addition to the messages understood by all handlers, the handler for
the additive synthesis algorithm understands the following messages:
<DL>
<DT>
SetFreq <TT>hSound x <I>time</I></TT></DT>

<DD>
Set the fundamental frequency to <TT>x</TT> Hz. If <TT>time</TT>
is specified, move to the new frequency over the specified duration.</DD>

<DT>
SetAmplPartials <TT>hSound array <I>time</I></TT></DT>

<DD>
Set the amplitudes of the first few partials (however many are specified)
to <TT>array</TT>. If <TT>time</TT> is specified, move
to the new amplitudes over the specified duration.</DD>

<DT>
SetIthAmpl <TT>hSound i x <I>time</I></TT></DT>

<DD>
Set the <TT>i</TT>'th partial's amplitude to <TT>x</TT>.
If <TT>time</TT> is specified, move to the new amplitude over the specified
duration. (Note: as of this writing, overlapping SetIthAmpl messages for
different partials with different <I><TT>time</TT></I>s may cause unexpected
results.)</DD>

<DT>
SetFDPartials <TT>hSound array</TT></DT>

<DD>
Set the frequency deviations of the first few partials (however many are
specified) to <TT>array</TT>.</DD>

<DT>
SetIthFD <TT>hSound x</TT></DT>

<DD>
Set the frequency deviation of the i'th partial to <TT>x</TT>.
<br>
As x ranges from -1 to 1, the i'th partial will have a frequency ranging 
from that of the (i-1)'th to that of the (i+1)'th.
</DD>

<DT>
SetFreqPartials <TT>hSound array</TT></DT>

<DD>
Set the absolute frequency (in Hz) of the first few partials (however many
are specified) to <TT>array</TT>. Valid range is [0, 24000].</DD>

<DT>
SetIthFreq <TT>hSound x</TT></DT>

<DD>
Set the absolute frequency of the i'th partial to <TT>x</TT>.</DD>
