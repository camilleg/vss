<h2>A basic two-operator frequency modulation implementation</h2>

The FM suite (fmActor, fmHand, fmAlg) provides an implementation of the frequency modulation 
synthesis algorithm, along with its associated vss handler and actor. The FM suite also provides 
a model for implementing other synthesis algorithms in the vss3.0 framework, by virtue of its 
completeness as a generator actor and by its relative simplicity. <p>

The synthesis algorithm is based upon two sinusoidal operators, the output of one modulating the 
phase of the other. A so-called "fm operator" is considered as a two-input black box sinewave 
generator. One input controls the frequency of the output sinusoid, the other, the instantaneous 
phase offset. This second input is called the "modulation input". This algorithm employs two 
operators, one as a modulator and one as a carrier. The output of the modulator ties to the 
modulation input of the carrier. The carrier output becomes the generated sound. <p>

The spectrum of the generated sound consists of a spike at the carrier frequency and an infinite, 
decaying train of spikes (e.g. "harmonics") on either side of the carrier frequency. The harmonics 
are spaced in frequency according to integer multiples of the sum and difference of the carrier and 
modulator frequencies. The amount of modulation, i.e. the amplitude of the modulation applied to the 
carrier, is called the "modulation index" and controls the resulting spectral width or "brightness" 
of the output. Larger modulation indices result in a "richer" or "brighter" sound. <p>

In addition, this algorithm implements "operator self-feedback". A controllable amount of the 
operator output is fed back to the operator's own modulation input. Spectrally, this also results in 
a train of harmonics spaced at even multiples of the operator's frequency. Depending upon the amount 
of feedback, this can lend a generally "warm", "brassy", or "buzzy" quality to the resulting tone, a
quality which is otherwise difficult or computationally expensive to achieve. The operator feedback 
is implemented on both operators. Placing it on the modulator allows for a controllable degree of 
non-sinusoidal modulation of the carrier, greatly extending the degree of tonal richness achievable 
with only two operators. <p>

Internally, the operators are a nice excercise in fast, linearly-interpolated sinusoidal wave-table 
lookup. The FM algorithm obeys the standard FM equations found in most introductory communications 
texts. For further investigation one may refer to the coverage of "Angle Modulation" in <u>Modern 
Communications and Spread Spectrum</u> by Cooper and McGillem, published by McGraw-Hill. <p>

To use the FM implementation, load fm.so and create an actor of type FmActor.

<h3>FmActor messages</h3>

In addition to the messages understood by all generator actors, the FmActor understands the following 
messages. If the optional parameter <tt>time</tt> is specified in any of the following messages, then 
the corresponding parameter is linearly modulated from the old value to the specified value over the 
duration of <tt>time</tt> seconds after receipt of the command. In the case of the commands 
SetAll[Param], the default [Param] is always set immediately on receipt of the command, regardless of 
<tt>time</tt>.

<dl>
	<dt>SetRatioMode <tt>hActor <i>bool</i></tt>
			<dd>Set the default frequency ratio mode for new instances created by this 
			actor to <tt>bool</tt>. Ratio Mode is active if <tt>bool</tt>=1, and is the 
			default if <tt>bool</tt> is unspecified. In Ratio Mode the modulator frequency 
			tracks changes in the carrier frequency according to the carrier/modulator 
			frequency ratio parameter set by CMratio or MCratio. Ratio Mode is useful for 
			changing the perceived "pitch" of the sound, without altering the perceived 
			"timbre" of the sound, by issuing a single SetCarFreq-style command. If 
			<tt>bool</tt>=0 then Ratio Mode is inactive and the carrier and modulator 
			frequencies are independent.
	<dt>SetAllRatioMode <tt>hActor <i>bool</i></tt>
			<dd>Set the current frequency ratio mode of all children to <tt>bool</tt>, 
			and set the default frequency ratio mode for new instances created by this 
			actor to <tt>bool</tt>. Ratio mode is active when <tt>bool</tt>=1 and is the 
			default if <tt>bool</tt> is unspecified. Refer to actor command SetRatioMode 
			for behavioral details of Ratio Mode.
	<dt>SetCarFreq <tt>hActor x</tt>
	<dt>SetModFreq <tt>hActor x</tt>
			<dd>Set the default carrier (modulator) frequency for new instances created 
			by this actor to <tt>x</tt>.
			(SetFreq is a synonym for SetCarFreq.)
	<dt>SetAllCarFreq <tt>hActor x <i>time</i></tt>
	<dt>SetAllModFreq <tt>hActor x <i>time</i></tt>
			<dd>Set the current carrier (modulator) frequency of all children to 
			<tt>x</tt>, and set the default carrier (modulator) frequency for all 
			future children to <tt>x</tt>. 
	<dt>SetCMratio <tt>hActor x</tt>
	<dt>SetMCratio <tt>hActor x</tt>
			<dd>Set the default carrier-to-modulator frequency ratio (modulator-to-carrier 
			frequency ratio) for new instances created by this actor to <tt>x</tt>.
	<dt>SetAllCMratio <tt>hActor x <i>time</i></tt>
	<dt>SetAllMCratio <tt>hActor x <i>time</i></tt>
			<dd>Set the current carrier-to-modulator frequency ratio (modulator-to-carrier 
			frequency ratio) of all children to <tt>x</tt>, and set the default CM ratio 
			(MC ratio) for all future children to <tt>x</tt>.
	<dt>SetModIndex <tt>hActor x</tt>
			<dd>Set the default modulation index for new instances created by this actor 
			to <tt>x</tt>.
	<dt>SetAllModIndex <tt>hActor x <i>time</i></tt>
			<dd>Set the current modulation index of all children to <tt>x</tt>, and set 
			the default modulation index for all future children to <tt>x</tt>. 
	<dt>SetCarFeedback <tt>hActor x</tt>
	<dt>SetModFeedback <tt>hActor x</tt>
			<dd>Set the default carrier (modulator) feedback amount for new instances 
			created by this actor to <tt>x</tt>.
	<dt>SetAllCarFeedback <tt>hActor x <i>time</i></tt>
	<dt>SetAllModFeedback <tt>hActor x <i>time</i></tt>
			<dd>Set the current carrier (modulator) feedback amount of all children to 
			<tt>x</tt>, and set the default carrier (modulator) feedback amount for all 
			future children to <tt>x</tt>.
</dl>

<h3>FM handler messages</h3>

In addition to the messages understood by all handlers, the handler for the FM algorithm understands 
the following messages. If the optional parameter <tt>time</tt> is specified in any of the following 
messages, then the corresponding parameter is linearly modulated from the old value to the specified 
value over the duration of <tt>time</tt> seconds after receipt of the command. 

<dl>
	<dt>SetRatioMode <tt>hSound <i>bool</i></tt>
			<dd>Set to the frequency ratio mode to <tt>bool</tt>. Ratio 
			mode is active when <tt>bool</tt>=1, and is the default if <tt>bool</tt> is 
			unspecified. Refer to actor command SetRatioMode for the behavioral details 
			of Ratio Mode.
	<dt>SetCarFreq <tt>hSound x <i>time</i></tt>
	<dt>SetModFreq <tt>hSound x <i>time</i></tt>
			<dd>Set the carrier (modulator) frequency to <tt>x</tt>.

	<dt>SetMCratio <tt>hSound x <i>time</i></tt>
			<dd>Set the carrier-to-modulator (modulator-to-carrier) frequency ratio for 
			this handler to <tt>x</tt>.
