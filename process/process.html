<h2>An example of a process actor</h2>

The Process suite (processActor, processHand, processAlg) implements a
"do-nothing" process actor which accepts an input and copies it unchanged
to its output.  As an example of a modifying message, it accepts one
parameter "ModIndex" which scales the amplitude of its output.  It is
intended as a starting point for writing other process actors.<p>

To use this process implementation (just to prove that it works, we suppose),
load process.so and create an actor of type ProcessActor.

<h3>ProcessActor messages</h3>

In addition to the messages understood by all generator actors, the ProcessActor understands the following messages:

<dl>
	<dt>SetModIndex <tt>hActor x</tt>
		<dd>Set the default index of modulation for new instances
created by this actor to <tt>x</tt>.
	<dt>SetAllModIndex <tt>hActor x <i>time</i></tt>
		<dd>Set the index of modulation of all children to <tt>x</tt>,
		and set the default index for all future children.
		If <tt>time</tt> is specified, children will modulate to the new
		index over the specified duration. Default index is always
		set immediately regardless of <tt>time</tt>.
</dl>

<h3>ProcessActor handler messages</h3>

In addition to the messages understood by all handlers, the handler for
the ProcessActor understands the following messages:

<dl>
	<dt>SetInput <tt>hSound hHandler</tt>
		<dd>Set the input to come from the handler <tt>hHandler</tt>.
	<dt>SetModIndex <tt>hSound x <i>time</i></tt>
		<dd>Set the index of modulation to <tt>x</tt>.  If
		<tt>time</tt> is specified, move to the new index over the
		specified duration.
</dl>
