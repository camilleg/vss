<h2>A simple random-noise implementation</h2>

The Noise suite implements a basic colored noise synthesis algorithm, along with its associated 
handler and actor. The noise is random, or repetitive, in nature. (Actually, it repeats once every 
2^48 samples, or at worst, once every 203 years at 44.1 kHz sampling rate. So, who's counting?) The 
noise is colored by filtering through a selectable zero-order or first-order hold process.<p>

Noise characteristics are controlled through two parameters: "Order", and "Cutoff". Order 
determines the filter type used for coloring the noise. Order=0 corresponds to a simple zero-order 
hold (i.e. sampled-and-held noise samples), while Order=1 corresponds to a first-order hold (i.e. 
linearly interpolated noise samples). Both types of filtering are lowpass in nature, with a falloff
slope of 6dB/octave for Order=0 and 12dB/octave for Order=1.<p>

Cutoff controls the frequency at which the noise spectrum falls off, i.e., is filtered out, and is 
expressed in Hz. Specifically, a cutoff of 1000Hz produces an output spectrum whose half-power 
point occurs at 443Hz for Order=0, and at 319Hz for Order=1.<p>

To use the Noise implementation, load noise.so and create an actor of type NoiseActor.

<h3>NoiseActor messages</h3>

In addition to the messages understood by all generator actors, the NoiseActor understands the following messages:

<dl>
	<dt>SetCutoff <tt>hActor x</tt>
			<dd>Set the default cutoff frequency for new instances created by this actor 
			to <tt>x</tt>.
	<dt>SetAllCutoff <tt>hActor x <i>time</i></tt>
			<dd>Set the cutoff frequency of all children to <tt>x</tt>, and set the 
			default cutoff for all future children. If <tt>time</tt> is specified, 
			children will modulate to the new cutoff over the specified duration. 
			Default cutoff is always set immediately regardless of <tt>time</tt>.
	<dt>SetOrder <tt>hActor bool</tt>
			<dd>Set the default filter order for new instances created by this actor 
			to <tt>bool</tt>, either 0 or 1.
	<dt>SetAllOrder <tt>hActor bool</tt>
			<dd>Set the filter order of all children to <tt>bool</tt>, and set the 
			default order for all future children.
</dl>

<h3>Noise handler messages</h3>

In addition to the messages understood by all handlers, the handler for the noise algorithm understands the following messages:

<dl>
	<dt>SetCutoff <tt>hSound x <i>time</i></tt>
			<dd>Set the cutoff frequency to <tt>x</tt>. If 
			<tt>time</tt> is specified, move to the new cutoff over the specified 
			duration.
	<dt>SetOrder <tt>hSound bool</tt>
			<dd>Set the filter order to <tt>bool</tt>, either 0 or 1.
</dl>
