# VSS virtual sound server

Version 4.2 is the same as 4.1, but excludes a few actors that incorporated copyrighted code.

To build the `vss` executable on linux: `make depend && make`

Prerequisites: `sudo apt-get install make g++ libasound2-dev`

To tidy up afterwards, if you need only that exe: `make clean`
